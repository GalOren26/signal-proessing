initial phase of this project involved constructing a dynamic model capable of generating realistic PPG signals with varying parameters such as amplitude, noise, time-period, and rising-time, utilizing Arduino Due.

The subsequent phase focused on implementing various signal processing algorithms like aptive filtering LMS  and finding minimum and maximum values. 
The objective was to extract intriguing features like Inter-Beat Interval (IBI), beats per minute (bpm), and rising times.
These features, along with the signal, were presented in real-time using PIC32-RTDSP.
